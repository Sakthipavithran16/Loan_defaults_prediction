# Loan_defaults_prediction

## Introduction
Banks deal with large volumes of customer data and transactions daily. There is a need to leverage this data to enhance customer experience, reduce risk, and optimize product offerings.

## Problem Statement
This project aims to solve three critical problems:
#### 1. Loan Default Prediction: 
Banks need to minimize financial risk by predicting which customers are likely to default on loans. Accurate predictions can lead to better loan approval processes and risk management.
#### 2. Customer Segmentation: 
By understanding customer behavior, banks can target their marketing strategies more effectively, enhancing customer satisfaction and increasing revenue.
##### 3. Product Recommendations: 
Recommending the right products to customers based on their past behavior can increase customer loyalty and boost cross-selling opportunities.

## Approach

## Supervised Learning: Loan Default Prediction
### Data Preprocessing: 
Cleaning and preparing the data, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables.
### Feature Engineering: 
Identifying important features and creating new ones if necessary.
### Model Training: 
Splitting data into training and test sets, training models, and tuning hyperparameters.
### Model Evaluation: 
Evaluating model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Unsupervised Learning: Customer Segmentation
### Data Preprocessing: 
Standardizing the data and selecting relevant features.
### Clustering: 
Applying clustering algorithms to group customers based on similar transaction patterns.
### Evaluation: 
Analyzing the clusters using visualization techniques and interpreting the results.

## Recommendation Engine: Product Recommendations
### Data Preprocessing: 
Preparing the data and handling sparsity in the customer-product matrix.
### Model Building: 
Implementing the recommendation algorithm and generating product recommendations.
### Evaluation: 
Measuring the effectiveness of recommendations using metrics like Precision and Recall.

### Streamlit UI
Using streamlit module,create an input field where user can enter each column value and predicted results are displayed.
